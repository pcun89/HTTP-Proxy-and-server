# HTTP Proxy and Server for Web Development

## Overview

This collaborative project focuses on web development using Python, specifically building a Python-based server and proxy for an HTML project. The objective was to enhance Python skills, tackle server-side complexities, and implement an efficient proxy setup to optimize external resource requests. I collaborated on this project with a partner.

## Project Features

### 1. Project Initiation

- **HTML Foundation:**
  - Defined a foundational HTML structure for web pages.
  - Included layout, styles, and responsiveness elements.

### 2. Python Server with Flask

- **Flask Framework:**
  - Chose Flask for its simplicity in web development.
  - Leveraged Flask's intuitive route definition and error handling.
  - Translated the HTML vision into server-side reality.

### 3. Proxy Server Implementation

- **Requests Library:**
  - Integrated Python's `requests` library for a lightweight proxy server.
  - Optimized external resource requests.
  - Streamlined the process of forwarding requests to external APIs.

### 4. Testing and Debugging

- **Rigorous Testing:**
  - Conducted thorough testing to ensure the reliability of the Python-based server and proxy.
  - Collaborative debugging sessions for swift issue identification and resolution.
  - Ensured smooth integration between HTML content, Flask server, and proxy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Flask framework
- Requests library

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/http-proxy-server.git
cd http-proxy-server
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Access the web application at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Conclusion

This collaborative Pythonic venture in building a server and proxy for an HTML project was a journey of enlightenment and fulfillment. The project successfully demonstrated the transformation of ideas into a functional web application through effective communication and shared debugging efforts. It emphasized Python's versatility in web development and showcased the synergy achievable through collaboration to achieve technical objectives. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to further enhancements of this project.
